**Thesis title**: Multi-Label Classification Of Medical Texts
</h1>

The Learning from Death morality Review (LeDeR) is an organisation focused on the reviewing of death reports for people with learning disabilities, this involves manually coding death reports with pre-determined labels a time consuming process. Here a program is proposed that suggests labels for the text based on a supervised learning algorithm (an SVM), the human coder can then reject or select the label based on the programs suggestions.

**Aims of Project**
<ul>
  <li>Increase the accuracy of coders</li>
  <li>Reduce the time taken to code a doccument</li>
  <li>Provide human interpretable coding suggestions</li>
  <li>Be implementable with minimum training</li>
</ul>

The project involved the use of the following technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- TQDM
- Matplotlib
